    "   The first thing that is different in this script is an initialized data variable; `data = []` creates the variable `data` as an empty `list` which we will populate as we read the file. Python `lists` are a collection data type that are ordered and changeable - meaning you can call information out of the `list` by its index and you can add or delete elements to your `list`. Lists are denoted by square brackets, `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Then with the datafile open for reading capabilities, we are going to write two separate `for` loops. A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a `list`). It is important to note the syntax of Python `for` loops: the `:` at the end of for `for` line, the tab-indentation of all lines within the `for` loop, and perhaps the absence of an `end for` that is found in languages such as Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In your first `for` loop, loop through the dummy variable `_` in `range(3)`. `range` returns a sequence of numbers, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 (by default), ending at the specified length. Here if you were to `print(_)` on each line of the `for` loop you would see:\n",

    "\n",
    "   So again, in the first `for` loop, you execute the `readline` command (which you will remember moves down to the next line each time it is consecutively called) 3 times to read through the file header (which is 3 lines long). You have just written your first `for` loop! \n",
    "\n",
    "   Then in a second `for` loop, you loop through lines in the remainder of your `datafile`. On each line, `split` it along white space. The string `split()` method splits a string into a list on a specified separator, the default being white space. You could use any character you like, but other useful options are `/t ` for splitting along tabs, or `,` along commmas. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Then you `append` this split line list to the end of your `data` list. The list `append()` method adds a single item to the end of your list. After every `line` in your `for` loop iteration, the `data` list that was empty is one element longer. Now we have a list of lists for our data variable - a list of the data in each line for multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you print each datum in data, you'll see that each datum is a list of string values.\n",
