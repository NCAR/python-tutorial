===========================
Requirements & Installation
===========================

If you don't have conda installed at all, `please install it. <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_

1. First, check that you have conda or miniconda installed on your OS by checking your conda version:

    $ conda --version
At the time of writing this, the latest version of conda is 4.8. If you have an old version of conda installed, update it.

2. If necessary, update:

    $ conda update
**NOTE** If you have a REALLY old version of conda it might be easier to delete it and then reinstall it. But before doing this you have to check your env-list to see if there are any environments you created and want to save.

3. Check your conda version again.

    $ conda --version



4. `Install git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_

Git is a program that tracks changes made to files. This makes it easy to maintain access to multiple versions of your code as you improve it, and revert your code back to a previous version if you've made any mistakes.
