## Setup

This tutorial covers the installation and setup of a Python environment on:

- Cheyenne
- Casper
- CGD's Hobart
- Personal laptop/desktop with a UNIX-variant Operating System

**NOTE:** For windows users, setup scripts provided in this repository don't
work on Windows machines for the time being.

### Step 1: Clone NCAR Python Tutorial Repository

Run the following commmand to clone this repo to your system(e.g. cheyenne,
casper, your laptop, etc...):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ncar-python-tutorial.git
```

### Step 2: Install Miniconda and Create Environments

Change directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd ncar-python-tutorial
```

and run the `setup/configure` script:

**NOTE**: Be prepared for the script to take up to 15 minutes to complete.

```bash
./setup/configure
```

If you want more information on how to use the configure script, use the `--help` (or `-h`)
option:

```bash
$ ./setup/configure --help
usage: configure [-h] [--clobber] [--download] [--prefix PREFIX]

Set up tutorial environment.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --clobber, -c         Whether to clobber existing environment (default:
                        False)
  --download, -d        Download tutorial data without setting environment up
                        (default: False)
  --prefix PREFIX, -p PREFIX
                        Miniconda3 install location)
```

Default values for ``--prefix`` argument are:

- Personal laptop / Hobart: `$HOME/miniconda3`
- Cheyenne or Casper: `/glade/work/$USER/miniconda3`

**NOTE**: In case the default `prefix` is not appropriate for you (due to limited storage),
feel free to specify a different miniconda install location. For instance, this install
location may be a `project` workspace on a shared filesystem like GLADE or Hobart's filesystem.

The `configure` script does the following:

- Install `conda` package manager if it is unable to find an existing installation. Otherwise,
  it will update the `base` environment
- Create or Update `python-tutorial` conda environment.
- Download data if not on Cheyenne or Casper or Hobart. If on Cheyenne or Casper or Hobart,
  create soft-links to an existing/local data repository.

### Step 3: Close and re-open your current shell

For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell.

### Step 4: Run the Setup Verification Script

Check that *conda info* runs successfully:

```bash
conda info
```

Then, from the `ncar-python-tutorial` directory, activate `python-tutorial` conda environment:

```bash
conda activate python-tutorial
```

and run the setup verification script to confirm that everything is working as expected:

```bash
cd ncar-python-tutorial
./setup/check_setup
```

This step should print **"Everything looks good!"**.

## Launch Jupyter Lab

### 1. Cheyenne or DAV via JupyterHub (Recommended)

**JupyterHub link:** [https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/](https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/)

To use the Cheyenne or DAV compute nodes,we recommend using JupyterLab via NCAR's
JupyterHub deployment.

Open your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc...) on your ``local machine``,
and head over to [https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/](https://jupyterhub.ucar.edu/).

**You will need to authenticate with either your _yubikey_ or your _DUO_ mobile app**

### 2. Cheyenne or DAV via SSH Tunneling

In case you are having issues with jupyterhub.ucar.edu, we've provided utility scripts for
launching JupyterLab on both Cheyenne and Casper via SSH Tunneling:

```bash
conda activate base
./setup/jlab/jlab-ch # on Cheyenne
./setup/jlab/jlab-dav # on Casper
```

### 3. Hobart via SSH Tunneling

For those interested in running JupyterLab on CGD's Hobart, you will need to use SSH
tunneling script provided in `setup/jlab/jlab-hobart`:

```bash
conda activate base
./setup/jlab/jlab-hobart
```

For additional help, use the `--help` (or `-h`) option:

```bash
$ ./setup/jlab/jlab-hobart --help
Usage: launch dask
Possible options are:
 -w,--walltime: walltime [default: 08:00:00]
 -q,--queue: queue [default: medium]
 -d,--directory: notebook directory
 -p,--port: [default: 8888]
```

### 4. Personal Laptop

For those interested in running JupyterLab on their local machine, you can simply run the
following command, and follow the printed instructions on the console:

```bash
conda activate base
jupyter lab
```
