Announcing the Fall 2019 NCAR Python Tutorial (September 18-20)!

<!-- TEASER_END -->

First, this tutorial will be workflow focused.  That is, we will be teaching
Python and some of the various Python tools through hands-on examples of real
world workflows, such as the calculation of ocean heat content and ENSO index
calculation.  Our hope is to give you, on Day 1, examples of how to use these
tools for real science, rather than delving into the tools themselves and
hoping you can synthesize the information.

Second, Days 2 and 3 (Sept 19-20) will give you the opportunity to collaborate
with each other on short projects (Sprints) or to attend optional lectures.
We hope that you will be willing to contribute a Sprint idea.  Don’t be afraid
to contribute your ideas!  They could be anything from a desire to convert
your favorite IDL (or Matlab or NCL) script, to Python to adding a new feature
to your favorite Python package, to developing a new Python package with the
help of other people in the room, to fixing that bug that’s been bothering you
for months!  If you don’t have an idea of what you’d like to Sprint on, you
can collaborate with other people on their Sprint ideas or sit in on optional
lectures to learn more about Python and existing Python tools.

What we need from you:

We need all of you to do a little preparation before you attend the tutorial.
There are multiple ways of participating in this tutorial, including running
the example notebooks on Cheyenne or Casper or on your personal laptop.
However you plan on participating in the tutorial, you need to follow the
instructions described in the README here:

Office Hours:

For those needing help setting your environment up for the tutorial, we will
be holding “Office Hours” from 9:00am to 12:00pm on Tuesday, Sept 17, in
ML-490C (Tower B). Feel free to stop by if you have questions before the
tutorial.
